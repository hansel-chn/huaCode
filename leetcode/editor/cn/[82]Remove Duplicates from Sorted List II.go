/**
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate
numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked
list sorted as well.


 Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]


 Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]



 Constraints:


 The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
 -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
